# Go Aggregator Project

## Overview
The Go Aggregator Project is a tool designed to aggregate and process data from multiple sources. It is built using the Go programming language and aims to provide a robust and efficient solution for data aggregation needs.

# Go Aggregator

A simple and efficient aggregator built in Go that collects and manages posts from various feeds. This application provides a RESTful API for interacting with the posts, allowing users to create, read, update, and delete posts seamlessly.

## Features

- RESTful API for managing posts
- Support for UUIDs for unique identification
- JSON serialization for data exchange
- Error handling for robust API responses
- Lightweight and efficient routing with Chi

## Technologies Used

- **Go**: The primary programming language for the application.
- **UUID**: For unique identification of posts and feeds.
- **Chi Router**: A lightweight router for building HTTP services.
- **Database**: Interaction with a database for storing and retrieving posts.
- **JSON**: For data serialization and deserialization.

## Installation

To get started with the Go Aggregator, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-aggregator.git
   cd go-aggregator
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Set up your database and configure the connection settings in the application.

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the API using tools like Postman or cURL. Below are some examples of how to use the API.

### Example Request

To create a new post, send a POST request to `/posts` with the following JSON body:

```json
{
    "title": "Sample Post",
    "description": "This is a sample post description.",
    "url": "https://example.com/sample-post",
    "feed_id": "your-feed-id"
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint        | Description                     |
|--------|------------------|---------------------------------|
| GET    | /posts           | Retrieve all posts              |
| POST   | /posts           | Create a new post               |
| GET    | /posts/{id}     | Retrieve a post by ID           |
| PUT    | /posts/{id}     | Update a post by ID             |
| DELETE | /posts/{id}     | Delete a post by ID             |

## Error Handling

The API provides meaningful error messages and HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests. For example, a 400 status code indicates a bad request, while a 404 status code indicates that the requested resource was not found.
